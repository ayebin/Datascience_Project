# Data Science Project
Our goal was to find solutions for sustainable diet.

## Introduction
- Re-define **sustainable diet**: Based on our literature review, we made our definition of a sustainable diet as “a diet that decreases calories and GHGe, and also consists of relatively cheap food.”
- Target: Our peers (19-29) who live in Korea

## Hypothesis
- The reason people don’t eat SD is cost, and in most developed countries, SD is cheaper than current diet. 
- Diet consisting of less meat and more vegetables is better than the current diet.
- Farming with less fertilizers can reduce the GHGe.

## Process
We collected data for analyzing problem and effectiveness of solutions.
Analyzing methods were including Indepedent t-test, Correlation analysis, One-sample t-test, etc.

## Code
Since we converted our code into html for submission and lost raw files, I have no choice but to upload only html files.
